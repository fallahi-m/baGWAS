# baGWAS
### An Inter-Breed GWAS Framework Integrating Individual-Level Genotype and Breed-Average Phenotypes

**baGWAS** is an R package for inter-breed genome-wide association analysis using individual-level genotype data and breed-average phenotypes through two complementary workflows:

- **`genoGWAS`** — breed-level genotype data-based GWAS using GEMMA linear mixed models.
- **`freqGWAS`** — breed-level allele frequency-based GWAS using group-level allele-frequency matrices, an IBS-derived breed relationship matrix, and EMMREML.

The package provides a single main entry point, `baGWAS()`, and returns a standardized GWAS result table together with reproducible output files, diagnostic plots, and a run log.

> **Status:** Development release 1.0.0. The current release is intended for Linux/macOS (Unix-like systems) and requires external command-line software for the GWAS workflows.

## Main function

```r
baGWAS.Res <- baGWAS(
  strategy = "",
  organism = "",
  pheno = pheno,
  covariate = NULL,
  trait = "",
  geno = ""
)
```

Choose one of the two strategies:

```r
strategy = "genoGWAS"
```

or

```r
strategy = "freqGWAS"
```

## Installation

baGWAS is designed to run on Ubuntu Linux and requires R packages and external command-line software.

## 1. Install external software on Ubuntu

Open the Ubuntu Terminal and install PLINK 1.9 and GEMMA:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install plink1.9 gemma

### Software requirements by strategy:
genoGWAS — requires PLINK for genotype-data preparation and GEMMA for linear mixed-model association analysis.
freqGWAS — requires PLINK 1.9 for breed-level allele-frequency and IBS calculations.

— For the current implementation, PLINK 1.9 is the recommended starting point.
— These external programs must be installed separately and accessible through the system `PATH` or the environment-variable configuration supported by baGWAS.

## 2. Install R package dependencies

The following R packages are required by baGWAS:

- `data.table`
- `EMMREML`
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `ggmanh`

The first four packages are available from CRAN. The `ggmanh` package is distributed through Bioconductor.

### Install R dependencies

Install the CRAN packages:

```r
install.packages(
  c("data.table", "EMMREML", "dplyr", "ggplot2"),
  repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
```

Install `ggmanh` from Bioconductor:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages(
    "BiocManager",
    repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
}

BiocManager::install("ggmanh")
```

### 3. Install baGWAS from GitHub

```r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github("fallahi-m/baGWAS")
```

Load the package:

```r
library(baGWAS)
```

## Quick start

### 1. genoGWAS (`breed-level genotype data-based GWAS`)

```r
library(baGWAS)

baGWAS.Res <- baGWAS(
  strategy = "genoGWAS",
  organism = "dog",
  pheno = pheno,
  covariate = covariate,
  trait = "weight",
  geno = "/data/geno"
)
```

### 2. freqGWAS (`breed-level allele frequency-based GWAS`)

For `freqGWAS`, `group_col` identifies the group/breed/population used to calculate allele frequencies and group-level relationships.

```r
baGWAS.Res <- baGWAS(
  strategy = "freqGWAS",
  organism = "dog",
  pheno = pheno,
  covariate = covariate,
  trait = "weight",
  geno = "/data/geno",
  group_col = "FID"
)
```

The `covariate` argument may be `NULL`. In that case, the model uses an intercept only.

## Input data

### Genotype data

`geno` is a PLINK binary dataset prefix. The following files must exist:

```text
genotypes.bed
genotypes.bim
genotypes.fam
```

Example:

```r
geno = "/home/user/data/geno"
```

A path ending in `.bed`, `.bim`, or `.fam` is normalized to the dataset prefix.

### Phenotype data

`pheno` must be a data frame containing:

```text
FID   IID   Sex   Breed   <Trait>

FID: group/family identifier assigned to each breed. Individuals belonging to the same breed must have the same FID.
IID: individual identifier.
Sex: sex of the individual.
Breed: breed or population name.
<Trait>: phenotype trait to be analyzed. The trait column must be numeric.

group_col — specifies the column used to define the breed/group structure. By default, group_col = "FID".
```

Example:

```r
pheno <- data.frame(
  FID = c("1", "1", "2"),
  IID = c("1", "2", "3"),
  Sex = c(1, 2, 1),
  Breed = c("Breed_A", "Breed_A", "Breed_B"),
  weight = c(42.1, 45.7, 47.3)
)
```


### Covariates
`Covariates` must be a data frame containing:

```text
FID   IID   Sex   Breed   <Covariate>

FID: group/family identifier assigned to each breed. Individuals belonging to the same breed must have the same FID.
IID: individual identifier.
Sex: sex of the individual.
Breed: breed or population name.
<Covariate>: numeric covariate variable included as a fixed effect in the GWAS model. Multiple covariates can be provided as additional columns.
```

## Supported organisms

The current PLINK species mapping implemented by baGWAS is:

| `organism` | PLINK flag |
|---|---|
| `dog` | `--dog` |
| `sheep` | `--sheep` |
| `cattle` | `--cow` |
| `cow` | `--cow` |
| `horse` | `--horse` |
| `mouse` | `--mouse` |
| `rice` | `--rice` |

These entries describe the organism keywords implemented by the package. Users should confirm that the selected PLINK option is appropriate for their dataset and analysis.

## Output

For a run with `output_dir = "<output_dir>"`, the package creates:

```text
<output_dir>/
└── Result/
    ├── genoGWAS/
    │   ├── baGWAS.Res
    │   ├── manhattan.png
    │   ├── qqplot.png
    │   └── baGWAS.log
    └── freqGWAS/
        ├── baGWAS.Res
        ├── manhattan.png
        ├── qqplot.png
        ├── baGWAS.log
        └── SNPs_with_errors.txt   # only when SNP models fail
```

`baGWAS.Res` contains the standardized columns:

```text
CHR   SNP   BP   P
```

The returned object is a data frame with the same core result columns and run metadata stored as attributes, including strategy, trait, organism, output directory, genomic inflation statistic (`lambda`), number of analyzed SNPs, and runtime.

## Diagnostic plots

Each successful strategy writes:

- `manhattan.png` — Manhattan plot of the GWAS p-values.
- `qqplot.png` — Q-Q plot with confidence band and the genomic inflation statistic (`lambda`).

## Reproducibility and logs

baGWAS records the strategy, organism, trait, sample and SNP counts, run timing, and diagnostic information in `baGWAS.log`.

Intermediate files are created in temporary working directories and are removed after the analysis finishes.

## Statistical scope

`genoGWAS` and `freqGWAS` are distinct analytical workflows and should not be interpreted as interchangeable methods. Before interpreting results, users should evaluate genotype quality control, phenotype definition, sample structure, covariates, group definitions, missing data, model assumptions, and multiple-testing procedures.

The package performs the computational workflow; it does not replace study-specific quality control, model diagnostics, or biological interpretation.

## Testing

The repository contains `testthat` tests for package-level validation and core R functionality. Full end-to-end GWAS execution additionally requires appropriate genotype data and the external PLINK/GEMMA executables.

Run local tests with:

```r
testthat::test_local()
```

Run an R package check with:

```bash
R CMD check .
```
